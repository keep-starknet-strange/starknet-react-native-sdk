# Starknet React Native SDK

Build **consumer-grade mobile dApps** on Starknet with React Native.

## 🚀 What is the Starknet React Native SDK?

The Starknet React Native SDK is a comprehensive software development kit that enables developers to build consumer-grade mobile applications on Starknet with React Native. By leveraging Starknet's native account abstraction capabilities, this SDK provides simple, high-level tools so that mobile app developers – even those with minimal Web3 experience – can integrate Starknet features into their iOS and Android apps.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔗 **Multi-Platform Support**
- **iOS and Android Compatible** - Works seamlessly on both platforms via React Native
- **Native Module Integration** - Interfaces with device capabilities like biometrics and secure storage
- **Optimized Performance** - Designed specifically for mobile environments

### 💼 **Wallet Integration**
- **External Wallet Support** - Seamless integration with Argent X, Braavos, and more via WalletConnect v2
- **Embeddable In-App Wallet** - Built-in wallet with biometric security (Phase 2)
- **Unified API** - Common interface across all wallet types

### 🔐 **Enhanced Security**
- **Biometric Authentication** - FaceID/TouchID integration for transaction signing
- **Secure Key Storage** - iOS Keychain and Android Keystore integration
- **Account Abstraction** - Leverages Starknet's native account abstraction features

### ⚡ **Advanced Features**
- **Gasless Transactions** - Paymaster support via AVNU and Cartridge
- **Session Keys** - Temporary keys for improved UX
- **Multi-call Transactions** - Batch multiple operations in one transaction

### 🧰 **Developer Experience**
- **TypeScript First** - Fully typed with comprehensive type definitions
- **React Hooks** - Familiar patterns for React Native developers
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Extensive test coverage and examples
- **Rich Documentation** - Detailed guides, API reference, and examples

## 📦 Quick Start

Get started with the Starknet React Native SDK in just a few steps:

```bash
npm install @starknet/react-native-sdk
# or
yarn add @starknet/react-native-sdk
```

```typescript
import {
  createProvider,
  getDefaultConnectors,
  StarknetNetwork
} from '@starknet/react-native-sdk'

// Create a provider
const provider = createProvider({
  networkId: StarknetNetwork.TESTNET,
  chainId: '0x534e5f5345504f4c4941'
})

// Get available wallet connectors
const connectors = getDefaultConnectors()
```
